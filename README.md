## Split Pane View Helper

Simple [Obsidian][1] plugin that adds a couple of configurable hotkeys and a toolbar button to quickly open a vertical or horizontal split view. The original pane is placed into 'source' mode and the new pane in 'preview' mode.

Also provides an assignable "close other panes" hotkey which will close all other panes except the most recently focused one.

Ideas borrowed from all around the web, Obsidian Discord channel, and other plugin authors who came before me. Thank you all.
